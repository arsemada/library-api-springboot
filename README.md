# Library API - Spring Boot REST API

This project is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API designed for managing a simple library catalog. It provides endpoints to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on books and authors. The API utilizes Spring Data JPA for database interaction with a PostgreSQL database, which is containerized using Docker for ease of setup and consistent development environment. The goal of this project is to demonstrate core Spring Boot concepts in building a practical backend application.
